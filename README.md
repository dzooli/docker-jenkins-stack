# Setting up a Jenkins playgroud## Purpose of this documentI have created this short tutorial for anyone who wants to test, improve knowledge, try something new about Jenkins CI/CD v2. The setup contains a Jenkins server a basic worker node and a PyTest capable worker node.## Requirements- Docker Desktop installed- Internet connection- basic knowledge about Docker- some understanding of Docker compose and docker-compose.yml file structure## Used tools and Docker images- Monitored for vulnerabilities by Bitnami- Preconfigured images for general usage- Minimized images- Non-root access for the applications (another level of security)Additional tool is your favourite text editor and a shell. As a Linux fan I prefer Git Bash.## Let's startWe are using Docker compose to create the necessary services. First is the Jenkins server:```yamlversion: '2'services:  jenkins:    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11 # or bitnami/jenkins:latest    ports:      - '8050:8080'      - '8043:8443'   # For Bitnami container using HTTPS      # - '50000:50000' # Enable JNLP port if you want to attach external workers using host networking    volumes:      - 'jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home'      # - './server-scripts:/usr/share/jenkins/ref'    environment:      JENKINS_HOME: /var/jenkins_home # For Bitnami    networks:      - jenkins-network```As the JNLP port is not exposed by default we are able to reach the JNLP functionality from inside ```jenkins-network``` only. After starting the stack with:```bashdocker-compose up --build```the server will be available on [http://localhost:8050/](https://localhost:8050/)and we can unlock the UI by copying the administrator password appeared on the container's console. Next we could create a real admin user and initialize the plugins if necessary (recommended).
