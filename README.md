﻿﻿# Setting up a Jenkins playgroud## Purpose of this documentI have created this short tutorial for anyone who wants to test, improve knowledge, try something new about Jenkins CI/CD v2. The setup contains a Jenkins server a basic worker node and a PyTest capable worker node.## Requirements- Docker Desktop installed- Internet connection- basic knowledge about Docker- some understanding of Docker compose and docker-compose.yml file structure## Used tools and Docker imagesUsually I am using Bitnami created Docker images as base images when available. Detailed reasoning is here: [https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-testlink#why-use-bitnami-images](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-testlink#why-use-bitnami-images)- Monitored for vulnerabilities by Bitnami- Preconfigured images for general usage- Minimized images- Non-root access for the applications (another level of security)Additional tool is your favourite text editor and a shell. As a Linux fan I prefer Git Bash.## Let's startWe are using Docker compose to create the necessary services. First is the Jenkins server:```yamlversion: '2'services:  jenkins:    # image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11 # or bitnami/jenkins:latest    image: bitnami/jenkins:latest    ports:      - '8050:8080'      - '8043:8443'   # For Bitnami container using HTTPS      # - '50000:50000' # Enable JNLP port if you want to attach external workers using host networking    volumes:      - 'jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home'      - 'jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins' # Use this for the Bitnami container      # - './server-scripts:/usr/share/jenkins/ref' # For Bitnami you must define JENKINS_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=yes      # - './server-config/config.xml:/usr/share/jenkins/ref/config.xml' # For Bitnami you must define JENKINS_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=yes    environment:      # JENKINS_PASSWORD: xxx # password for the Bitnami container, def.: password      # JENKINS_USERNAME: admin # username for the Bitnami container, def.: user      JENKINS_HOME: /var/jenkins_home # For Bitnami      JENKINS_EXTERNAL_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER: 8050 # For Bitnami      JENKINS_EXTERNAL_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER: 8043 # For Bitnami      JENKINS_ENABLE_HTTPS: yes # For Bitnami          networks:      - jenkins-network```As the JNLP port is not exposed by default we are able to reach the JNLP functionality from inside ```jenkins-network``` only. After starting the stack with:```bashdocker-compose```the server will be available on [https://localhost:8043/](https://localhost:8043/)and we can login as administrator with user:password credentials.
